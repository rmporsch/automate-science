# What is version control

## Definition

**A version control system is software that tracks and manges changes to files over their lifetime**

* allows to revert back to previous versions
* restore accidentally deleted files
* try something new without inferring with the existing version
* review why something broke
* coordinating with others
* maintain multiple versions of the same project

## Why use git?

* its either `git` or `svn`
* `git` has become very popular
* `git` is used by nearly everyone in computer science
* `git` is flexible
* `git` is easy to use
* `git` has a large supporting packages and tutorials

# Basics of git

## Example Project

**Lets say you have some project with the following files:**

```
data.csv
analysis.R
analysis_2.R
analysis_02122016.R
results.txt
```

You actually only need 3 files (data.csv, analysis.R, results.txt)


## Snapshots

<img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png" width="600" height="100" />

* git takes a snapshot of all your files  (line a picture)
* if files haven't changed it creates a link to the previous identical file
* each version is like a mini file system

## Integrity of snapshots

* you can make changes in snapshots 
* but it is **impossible** to change files in previous snapshots and `git` NOT knowing about it
  * you cannot lose information
  * but you still can modify your files
  * git just creates a new snapshot for you
* each snapshot gets a name (by computation)
  * `24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373`
  * called a checksum
  * its unique

## The Three States

## Basic Workflow

* you modify some files
* you stage the files you want to commit
* you do a commit and store the snapshot in your database

## Why is there a staging and committing stage

* you can add files progressively 
* you can review files before committing
* it checks if files might have been modified but not added

# Practical Example With Rstudio

## Rstudio's git interface

* Rstudio has a nice interface to git
* You can also use the command like (called `Git Bash` in windows)
   * Linux and Mac users can just use the terminal

**Task 1:**

* create a new R project under version control
* within this project create the following files:
    * `analysis.R`
    * README.md
* write something in the files


## Insert your credentials

**Task 2:**

* open the terminal (or `Git bash`)
* go to your project folder
    * for example use: `cd /C/project/version-control-demo`
    * cd means `change directory`
    * you can use `<TAB>` for autocomplete

Change the git configuration with:

```bash
git config --global user.email "your@mail.com"
git config --global user.name "YourFirstName YourLastName"
```

## Commit Changes

**Task 3:**

* stage your files
* commit your files
* type `git log` in your terminal

## The command line

* the command line is not essential
* its useful to know anyway

**git add:**

```bash
git add analysis.R
```

**git commit:**

```bash
git commit -m "message"
```

**git log:**

```bash
git log
```

## Some more useful commands

```bash
git init
```

```bash
git clone
```

# Project: Iris

## Data Description

```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

## Groups

* Form groups of 3-4
* get the repository with `git clone` from github
* Open the `analysis.R` file

**Tasks:**

* each member completes one task in `analysis.R` 
* if you don't know how it works, just google a bit
* merge your different versions together

## Task View

```bash
git clone ...
```

* Complete tasks in `analysis.R`
* create a new repository on github (you need to make an account)
* invite your team members
* use `git push` to add your work
* **I purposefully  did not explain everything**


# Branches

## What are branches?

**Divert from your current work and start something new without messing up your latest files**

**Example:**

```{r, eval=F}
data(iris)
summary(iris)

new_functions <- function(k) {
  return(k^2)
}
```

```{r, eval=F}
new_functions <- function(k) {
  return(k*2)
}
```

## Branches


```bash
git branch testing
git checkout testing
```

<img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/head-to-master.png" width="600" height="100" />

## Branches

```
git checkout testing
```

<img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/head-to-testing.png" width="600" height="100" />


## Branches

```
git commit -a -m 'made a change'
git checkout master
```

<img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/checkout-master.png" width="600" height="100" />

## Branches

```
git commit -a -m 'made other changes'
```

<img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/advance-master.png" width="600" height="100" />

## Merging

* lets say you developed a new model in a separate branch `new_model`
* you want to merge this branch into your main branch `master`

```bash
git checkout master
git merge new_model
```
<div class="centered">
**merge conflicts** or **no merge conflicts**
</div>

## Merge conflicts

```{r, eval=F}
<<<<<<< HEAD:analysis.R
summary(iris)
=======
summary(iris[,1])
>>>>>>> iss53:analysis.R
```

You can use `git mergetool` to manage merge conflicts

# Exercise: Using Everything to Analyse a dataset

## Project

* please form again groups of 3-4 people
* this project will be the basis of the next part of the workshop
* chose a data set
* analyse the data set 
    * decide who does what (tasks will be given)
    * make a new github repository
    * it should be one script which does all the work

## The datasets and Research Questions

## The tasks

* What are the summary statistics
  * tables
  * plots (save plots to disk)
* What is your model?
  * What is the performance of your model?
  * What variables are relevant
* Give a brief presentation

**Some example:**

```{r}
data(iris)
print(summary(iris))

jpeg("histogram.jpeg")
hist(iris[,2])
dev.off()
```
