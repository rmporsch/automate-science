# Introduction

## Topics

* Introduction
* Version Control
* Analysis Pipeline 
  * Dynamic Documents

## About Me

* PhD student at the Department of Psychiatry
* Actually at the Center of Genomic Science (CGS)
* Mostly statistical analysis of genomic data and method development
* I do most of my analysis in `R`, `Python`, and `C++`

# What is reproducibility and Why is it important?

## Some general statistics

A recent (2016) survey by [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038%2F533452a) found that:

* 70% of scientist fail to reproduce other scientist's experiments 
* 50% fail to reproduce their own experiments
* 2% admitted to falsify study results
* 14% say they know at least one person who falsified study results

## Replication vs. Reproducibility

Some clarification what is the difference between the two ([Source](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/08/24/replication-crisis/)):

* *replication*: The act of repeating an entire study
* *reproducibility*: Usage of the same data and computer code to reproduce the original study

Here I want to focus on **reproducibility** only.
However, these two are intertwined 

## Crisis of Replication in Psychology

* Only 36 of 100 papers from high-ranking journals were successfully [replicated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315443)
* Social Psychology had a lower replication rate than Cognitive Psychology

**Why is that? (from a Data perspective)**

* data is not shared
* analysis code is not shared
* p-value fishing
* faster speed of data prodcution

**Its a multi facet problem**

## Replication Problems in Medicine

* [FDA](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F08989629208573811) found flaws in 10-20% of studies (1977-90) ()
* in a sample of 49 [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16014596))
    * 16% of studies investigating therapy effects were contradicted by later studies
    * 44% were replicated
    * 24% were never challenged 

* data is rarely published in medical trail studies
* protocols are not shared
* BUT: pre-registration is more common
* sample sizes are commonly larger

## How can reproducibility help?

**Some Steps you can do:**

* Publish your data
* Publish your analysis script
* Enable others to build on to your data/analysis
* make your data citeable
* have a public repository

**Some additional perks:**

* you automate your whole analysis
* you automate your paper
* you add credibility and accountability

# Example

## The project

* You collect data on the prevalence of diabetes in HK
* In addition you also collect data on:
    * living conditions (SES, occupation, marital status, etc.)
    * basic data on height, weight, etc.
    * average consumption of sugar

**Question:**

What factors are correlated with diabetes status?

## Data Processing

* Data is **messy**
  * missing values
  * variables which are partially overlapping
* Data needs to be prepared

**Benefits of automating this:**

* it can be repeated
* errors can be tracked down
* the process is documented 
* it can be re-used

## Data Processing

<img src="images.png"/>

* each iteration is a different model
* the next iteration does not mean its a better model
* each step needs to be documented (in case you want to go back)

## Version Control

**Keep the process under version control**

<img src="branch.png"/>

* each branch is a different model/version/idea
* each dot is a different state of that idea
* allows to keep track of what you have done
* allows to go back to previous versions

## Presentation of your Results

* copying from the analysis to the report can create mistakes
* labor intensive
* not fun
* you might need to do it multiple times

**Solution:**
Automate it!

## Automation via dynamic documents

*dynamic documents* are responsive to changes in the source code

**Lets say you have the following code:**

```{r}
mean(cars$speed)
```

**In a dynamic document you could write:**

The mean speed of analysed cars was `mean(cars$speed)`.

**Which would result in:**

The mean speed of analysed cars was `r mean(cars$speed)`.

# Outline

## Part 1 - Version Control

* How is version control useful for data analysis?
* The basics of version control using `git`
* Create a `git` project, add some files and commit
* Going back in history (`git` style)
* Branching
* Github and others
* Group project

## Part 2 - Analysis Pipelines and Dynamic Documents

* The concept of analysis recipes
* MakeFiles and others
* The Basics of `Rmakrdown`
* Tables and Figures
* Advanced `Rmakrdown` - using the cache, complicated tables, references and more
* Group Project

# Setup

## Software

* R (Rtools)
* Rstudio
* Git


## What is R?

R is an open source programming language and software environment for **statistical computing**

* rich infrastructure and environment
* made by statistician for statistician
* high level programming language
* command line interpreter
* Rtools adds additional functions to your system

![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:R_logo.svg)

**Rstudio** makes R prettier and easier to use.

## What is Git?

* git is a version control system developed by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)
* used to manage source code in software development
* drives today's software development
* the core principle of [Github](www.github.com)
